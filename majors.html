      After years of integrated teaching and mentorship in college classrooms,
      Envoc is investing in a more permanent involvement by funding development
      of the new lab, said Envoc CEO Calvin Fabre. Officially opened Jan. 29,
      the new lab will provide a work-like environment on campus that is an
      extension of Envoc’s company culture and mission to create a better
      reality.<br />
      “Many of our Envoceans at our Hammond office are Southeastern graduates,
      as am I, and we like to stay involved and create learning opportunities
      for future developers,” said Fabre. “We personally help develop the
      computer science curriculum at Southeastern, and some of our Envoceans
      even facilitate project classes, offering students an opportunity to work
      side-by-side with thriving professionals on innovative projects. The
      Innovation Lab enhances that experience on campus.”
